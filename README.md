# BT Weapon Balance Mod.

## Design Goals

1.Univeral Ammo Distrobution amongst weapons of matching archetypes.
2. Universal Magazine amongst weapons of matching archetypes.
3. Universal Firemodes amongst weapons of matching archetypes.
4. Extended and Revamped AI engagement ranges allowing for AI to pose a significant threat to friendly units in combat.
5. One Change, Far Impacts. 

## Universal Ammo Distrobution

Primary objective is to standardize all ammo types across the board between the different mods, by patching them with a singular mod enabling granular control of what weapon fires what round and does what damage.

## Universal Magazine 

Currently across the different mods there is a significant imbalance of what magazines are available for what gun, their velocities, and their capacity. this will serve to rectify that.

## Universal Firemodes

Currently, the primary focus on this is to standardize the firemodes across different mods for the same weapons as well as enable the AI to engage at further distances than vanilla with a logical flow of engagement fire rates. 
See below table for an example. Vanilla most AI will begin engagement at 600 or so meters but *not* engage below 50 meters. this is a huge issue.

## One Change, Far Impacts

With this editing one singular HPP file will propogate the changes across the board enabling bulk edits when balancing is required.
